# OpenGLTutorial
The code I created while working through the OpenGL tutorial here: https://learnopengl.com/

### Demo
Example of a completely instanced asteroid belt I made. There are only three draw calls: One for the planet, one for the asteroids, and one for the skybox. On a 2080 Ti, I can achieve 120+ FPS with 1 Million instances at 1440p.
